# CvsCSharp

this is a simple project to compare C and C# performances in computational tasks
you can test this by your self by running **compile.bat** first then **run.bat**

in run.bat you can change how many times you want to run each test

you can automate it by someting like
```
for /l %%x in (1,1,%%count) do 
```
and then run your stuff there

don't forget to redirect the standard output to a file
```.run.bat >> results.txt```
